            <h1>what is replate?</h1>
            <p>Replate is a way to reduce food waste and stop hunger in your community. Restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, or anywhere else that serves food can register with replate as a donor. When things are about to expire and end up in the trash or if there's been too much food prepared, businesses can sign on to our user friendly platform and request a pickup. Volunteers in the area are then alerted and can accept the task. Once the food has been picked up, volunteers bring it to predetermined places of need such as soup kitchens, shelters, and food banks. It's that simple!</p>

                      <p>According to the USDA, it is estimated that 30-40% of the country's food supply goes to waste. While this large percentage of our food supply goes to waste 40 million people in the United States are struggling with hunger, and an estimated 15 million households are considered food insecure.</p>

                      <p>That amount of wasted food is worth $161 billion. Since the national average spent on food is $2.79 per meal, this means approcimately 58,064,516,129 meals ended up in a landfill. Replate aims to keep those meals out of the trash and in the hands of those in need, and you can help.</p>
